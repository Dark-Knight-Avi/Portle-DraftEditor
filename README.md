## Features

- Written in Draft.js
- Typing # as the first string in a line & pressing space should make anything you type afterwards on the same line be in a “Heading” format. On pressing space the aforementioned # will disappear.
- Similarly, typing * as the first string in a line and pressing space should correspond to “bold” format
- ** and space = red line
- *** and space = underline
- Pressing Save button will persist everything typed in the editor into localstorage. On refreshing the page,  the saved info will be refilled into the editor.
